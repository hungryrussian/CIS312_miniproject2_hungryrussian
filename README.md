CIS-312 Mini-Project #2
Python Programming
Instructions: Use the cookie recipe and bill-of-materials (BOM) assignment you completed in
week 3 and write a Python program that will prompt the user for a number of cookies (or
whatever item for which you created a BOM). The program will take this information and
generate a list of detailed ingredients, the amounts required to make that amount of the food item
and the cost. The output should include a COMPLETE recipe (or a link to the recipe) with details
of the amounts required of each ingredient, the expected cost of each item, and the total cost
required to produce the requested amount. There should be an ingredients section followed by
the instructions for the recipe (Reference some recipe websites for ideas on the output).
For example, your output might contain something like the following:
*****************************************************************************
To make 500 white chocolate Macadamia nut cookies, you will need:
5 eggs, which will cost approximately $1.25
8.69 cups of white chocolate, which will cost approximately $34.51
…
The total expected cost for all ingredients is …
Followed by the recipe (or link to it).
*****************************************************************************
An additional requirement is for you to use a conditional statement (IF, ELIF, …, ELSE) in your
program. You determine what feature you want to implement in the program to use this
requirement. You might consider different prices for bulk orders of ingredients (if you really
want to push yourself), reporting to the user something about the number of cookies they are
baking, etc. Be creative (it counts for this project).
